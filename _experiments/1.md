This is the first of hopefully many more short web animation challenges. Above you can see the final product (try clicking the buttons to change color!). The gif below was my inspiration by [Jacob SÃ¸rensen on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/3217458-Dot-attack). I saw the animation online and wanted to challenge myself to create it.

To accomplish this, I used [anime.js](https://animejs.com/) to power the animations. I used [this](https://codepen.io/juliangarnier/pen/MZXQNV?editors=0110) example for the code to lay out the grid, then set out to make the rest of the animation. The 'randomness' is from a Simplex Noise generator. If you haven't used it, simplex noise generates 'smooth' looking noise.  You can see a demo running [here]( https://codepen.io/jwagner/pen/BNmpdm/?editors=001). Notice that the noise isn't completely random, and rather looks like clouds. In fact, simplex noise can be used to generate all sorts of things, like terrain or land forms in video games due to this property. In this case, it helps the animation transition more smoothly because nearby dots tend to rise and fall together. 

If you want to see how I did it, check out the code on [my github](https://github.com/Talor-A/taloranderson.com/blob/master/_scripts/experiments/1.js)!
