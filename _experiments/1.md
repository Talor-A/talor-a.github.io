### Web Animation Challenge 1: Dot Grid

This is the first of hopefully many more short web animation challenges. I saw this animation by [Jacob SÃ¸rensen on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/3217458-Dot-attack) and wanted to challenge myself to create it. I decided to use `anime.js`, an awesome animation library for the web.
