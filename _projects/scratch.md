[Scratch.app](//scratch.app) is a learning tool for students developed in Canoga Park, CA. As a frontend developer, I brought the project from early alpha stage to functional beta. Currently entered in Cal Poly Pomona's [Learn Through Discovery Program](https://www.cpp.edu/~learndiscovery/students/project-hatchery.shtml) and [Bronco Startup Challenge](http://broncostartupchallenge.com).
