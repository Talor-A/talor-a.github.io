The 8-puzzle problem is an interesting problem for artificial intelligence. I completed this as part of my CS 4200 (Artificial Intelligence) course at Cal Poly Pomona. You can see the completed code on [github](https://github.com/Talor-A/8-puzzle-solver).

## Problem Description

An 8-puzzle is a simple toy with 8 tiles in a 3x3 grid, with one free space allowing neighboring tiles to be slid into the empty space. For programming purposes, the tiles are numbered 1..8 with 0 being the free space. An example scrambled puzzle is on the left, and the goal state (0..9 in ascending order) is shown on the right.

```
|1 4 2|     |0 1 2|
|6 7 5| --> |3 4 5|
|8 3 0|     |6 7 8|
```

## Results

These figures were created by appending 1000 rows to a .csv file (menu option 4) of completely randomly generated solved puzzles. Then, I analyzed the outputted data to get the following statistics. The `Generator` class created puzzles with depths ranging from 10-30. Execution was very slow given that the solution only runs on a single thread, and a better implementation would solve many puzzles in parallel. Because of the long execution time these figures only represent heuristic 1, though both are implemented.
