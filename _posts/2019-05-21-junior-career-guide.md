freelancing in college

main points:

1. Projects
2. Networking
3. work



1. **Attention Step**:  Entering the world of freelancing can seem like a scary thing. How much should I charge? Where do I find jobs? How do I convince them to hire me? These were all questions I faced as a freelancer starting my work, and I hope I can put to rest some of the fears that you might be facing about getting your first clients.
2. **Significance**: I was fortunate to start my first job making wordpress sites in high school for a local business, before I even planned on going to college for computer science. Now, I balance attending college full-time with client work on weekends, school breaks, and in my free time. 
3. **Thesis Statement**: We can break down how you can get started freelancing into three topics:
   - Building a portfolio
   - Finding interested clients
   - Operating as a freelancer



(**Transition**: Now, something you may not know is that Los Angeles is known as the ‘Birthplace of Skateboarding’. But how did it get this name?)



**Body**

1. **Your portfolio** is what you'll use as an example of what you can do for a possible client. 

   1. First you'll need to determine what your focus is. 
      1. I decided to focus on web design, as that's where my initial experience was.
         I created a small portfolio of my previous work, which has now grown to include several custom client websites and my internship work. It isn't the strongest one out there, but it doesn't have to be! Remember - your career is just starting. 
   2. Next, you'll want to figure out a way to show your portfolio to others.
      1. Some people create a website. This is a great way to make a public 
      2. You don't have to do too much though. Most clients have been just fine with me emailing them a few screenshots of my past work, but of course this will depend on the nature of the service you're providing. 
   3. Lastly, remember that your portfolio is just a way to show off what **you** can do. 
      1. Being able to confidently talk about what you do and how is just as important.
      2. You should not limit yourself by what's on your portfolio.

2. **Meet new people.**

   1.  One of the most important things you can do for yourself and for your career is to always be open to meeting new people. 

      1. As a freelancer, I've actually never taken a job from a job board or other website. Instead I've met my clients:

         - In class
         - Rock climbing
         - Through family friends
         - At a concert

         When working with people you know, I personally have felt much safer and less in danger of getting ghosted / taken advantage of (though you should always be careful).

      2. Taking the time to 

3. **Know your worth.**

   1. 

**Conclusion**



1. **Summary**:  Remember that this is just the beginning of your journey. It won't be easy. You might not land that client you were counting on. You'll f*** up sometimes. If that happens, chalk it up to a learning experience and try again. 
2. **Clincher**:  So, the next time you hear about one of these celebrities or brands, I hope you remember there’s a lot more history there than meets the eye. Thank you.
