This is a compilation / reference of my favorite web design resources. This list is in progress, but will be continually updated!

# Community
- [Dev.to](https://dev.to)

# Tools

- [Typora](https://typora.io): The best markdown editor (for mac) and the tool I use for class notes, generating reports, and writing these blog posts
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com): The best code editor I've tried. Why? The great plugin ecosystem makes it great for almost any application or project. It's fast, not a memory hog like Atom and other javascript-based editors of its kind. 

# Documentation

- [devdocs.io](https://devdocs.io/): super fast, offline documentation for popular programming languages and frameworks.

# Design

- [heropatterns.com](heropatterns.com): scalable svg and css based backgrounds for websites. The header for this article and a few others are generated from this site.
- [cssfx](http://cssfx.dev): clean CSS interactions with no unnecessary markup. 
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com): used in the header of this site. play nice out of the box with CSS styles

# Lists

- [Awesome-Design-Resources](https://github.com/LisaDziuba/Awesome-Design-Tools/blob/master/README.md#color-picker-tools): exactly what it sounds like.
