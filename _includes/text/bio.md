My name's Talor Anderson. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, and I'm currently studying Computer Science at Cal Poly Pomona (graduating 2020). I'm fluent with Python and JavaScript and have created mobile apps with React Native. I love creating new and engaging experiences for web and mobile. If you're interested in working together, [get in touch]().

Outside my work, I love to rock climb, fly drones, and take walks with my pup. 

Below, check out the projects I've worked on or see my [resume]({{site.resume_url}}).
