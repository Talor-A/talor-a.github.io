# About Me

I'm a software developer and creative coder, passionate about exploring how software can shape the world and the people around us.

Currently, I'm finishing up my **B.S. in Computer Science** at **Cal Poly Pomona**, graduating May 2020. My focus has been in general software development, with an emphasis in web technologies as well as data science & machine learning.

I'm also a part-time web developer, currently with [Scratch.app](//scratch.app){:target="_blank"} building an educational platform for students, teachers, and universities.

I am looking for full-time roles or interesting contract opportunities after graduation.

Outside my work, I love to climb rocks, shoot photos, fly drones, and take walks with my [pup](//www.instagram.com/thatsabiglab/).
