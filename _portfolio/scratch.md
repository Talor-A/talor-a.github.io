## About

Scratch Tools, LLC. is headquartered in the Canoga Park area of Los Angeles, CA. They were a small startup hoping to make big changes in the educational world, and contacted me to help them move from early alpha stage of development to a presentable beta for testing and raising investor funds.

## Problem

Before I started at Scratch, the web app that had been developed was a simple proof of concept. I was tasked with two challenges: First, implementing a custom file manager frontend in javascript for users to save and organize math notes. Second, to redo the sites design following mockups and brand guidelines that had been recently developed by the team's designer. 

## Results

I was able to create an interface for users to drag and drop files and folders to organize their documents, edit, rename, and delete them, and more features.

Heres the final product.

## Conclusion

Over the course of this project I was able to write a lot of code in straight JavaScript with a bit of JQuery to help. Previously I had more experience with using frameworks like React, so it was refreshing and different to break out of that type of mould. I'll be working more with Scratch in the future and I am eagerly awaiting the product launch.
